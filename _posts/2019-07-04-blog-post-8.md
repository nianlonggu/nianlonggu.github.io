The Jupyter notebook is available at my github: [SupportVectorMachine/SVM-Tutorial](https://github.com/nianlonggu/SupportVectorMachine/blob/master/SVM-solver/SVM-Tutorial.ipynb)



First of all, we need to implement the SVM solver based on the SMO algorithm.


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os
from keras.datasets import mnist
```

    Using TensorFlow backend.


We define some auxilary functions. The following two functions are related with the kernel function and kernel matrix


```python
""" kernel part for SVM """
def kernel_func(x1,x2, kernel_type=None):
	if kernel_type is None:
		return np.dot( x1,x2)
	elif kernel_type["name"]=="GAUSSIAN":
		sigma = kernel_type["params"][0]
		return np.exp(- np.dot( x1-x2, x1-x2 )/(2*sigma**2)  )

def get_kernel_matrix( x1, x2, kernel_type=None ):
	num_samples_x1 = x1.shape[0]
	num_samples_x2 = x2.shape[0]
	kernel_matrix = np.zeros([num_samples_x1, num_samples_x2])
	for nrow in range(num_samples_x1 ):
		for ncol in range(num_samples_x2  ):
			kernel_matrix[nrow][ncol] = kernel_func(x1[nrow] , x2[ncol], kernel_type = kernel_type)
	return kernel_matrix
```

Then we need to implement the SVM solver part, which is encapsulated into a class


```python

Define some auxilary functions for compute the distance matrix, which is used to estimate the sigma for Gaussian Kernel, generator folder and plot the results.


```python
def distance_matrix( x,y, metric = "Euclidean" ):
	def distance( a,b ):
		if metric == "Euclidean":
			return np.linalg.norm(a-b)
	n_row = x.shape[0]
	n_col = y.shape[0]
	dis_matrix = np.zeros([n_row, n_col] )
	for r in range( n_row ):
		for c in range(n_col ):
			dis_matrix[r][c] = distance( x[r], y[c])
	return dis_matrix

def generate_folder(path):
	if not os.path.exists(path):
		os.makedirs(path)
	return path

# This plot results is used to plot the results on training dataset, e.g, what the separating hyperplane looks
# like, how the support vectors are distributed, and whether the points are correctly classified
def plot_results( x,y, support_ind, pred_y, title = "", img_save_path = None , show_img = True ):

	fig, ax = plt.subplots()


	x_low_dim = x[:,:2]

	x_support =  x[support_ind]
	y_support = y[support_ind]
	pred_y_support = pred_y[support_ind]

## Test the kernel SVM on linearly non-separable data

First we load the data


```python
def load_data(num_samples = 1000):
	x1 = []
	x2 = []
	for _ in range(num_samples):
		while True:
			r_x = np.random.multivariate_normal( [0,1], [[20,0],[0,1]], 1 )
			if r_x[0,1]>np.sin( r_x[0,0] )+0.5:
				x1.append( r_x )
				break
		while True:
			r_x = np.random.multivariate_normal( [0,-1], [[20,0],[0,1]], 1 )
			if r_x[0,1]<np.sin( r_x[0,0] ):
				x2.append( r_x )
				break

	x1 = np.concatenate( x1, axis =0 )
	x2 = np.concatenate( x2, axis =0)
	y1 = np.ones([num_samples]) *-1
	y2 = np.ones([num_samples]) *1
	x = np.concatenate([x1,x2], axis =0)
	y = np.concatenate([y1,y2], axis =0)

	return x, y
```

What does this loaded data look like? Let's load and plot it.


```python
x,y = load_data(500)
x_val, y_val = load_data(100)
## x,y are used for training, and x_val, y_val are used for validation
x_pos = x[y==1]
x_neg = x[y==-1]
plt.plot( x_pos[:,0], x_pos[:,1], "^", markerfacecolor='none' )
plt.plot( x_neg[:,0], x_neg[:,1], "o", markerfacecolor='none' )
plt.show()
```

From the figure, we can see that these points of two classes are obviously linearly non-separable, therefore we need to use the kernel SVM, and use Gaussian Kernel. Note that in the Gaussian Kernel there is a parameter: sigma, which represents the standard deviation. 

The SVM results are very sensitive to the selection of sigma. 
1. If sigma is too small, the model is going to overfit. Then the training/validation accuracy would be high, but the percentage of support vectors will be extremely high -- almost every point is a support vector! 
2. If sigma is too large, the model is going to underfit. The percentage of suport vector "might" be lower. However, the training/validation accuracy is low, which means the separating hyperplane is not accurately learned.

In this experiment, I used an empirical way to estimate the sigma: 
> Given the training dataset $X$, we use the function distance_matrix($X$,$X$) to compute the distance matrix w.r.t the element in $X$. Then we can use the average value of the distances between point pairs. Moreover, we can use a factor, such as 0.5, to adjust the value of $\sigma$.


```python
estimated_sigma = np.mean( distance_matrix( x,x ) ) * 0.5
print(estimated_sigma)
svm= SVM_Solver( kernel_type = {"name":"GAUSSIAN", "params":[estimated_sigma] } )
```

Then, we can train our SVM model!

Ok, let's have a look of the results by plotting it!


```python
plot_results( x,y, svm.support_ind, pred_y= svm.predict(x), title = "",show_img = True )
```


![png](/images/blogs/2019-07-04-SVM/SVM-Tutorial_18_0.png)


Several conclusions can be drawn:
1. the training dataset is correctly separated, which implies an accurate separating hyperplane;
2. The support vectors (points with solid color) are only located around the margin area, which indicates a good selection of the kernel parameters. This SVM is neither over-fit nor under-fit.

We can further evaluate the accuracy on test dataset:


```python
x_test, y_test = load_data( 500 )

pred_y=svm.predict(x_test)
test_acc =  np.sum( pred_y == y_test  )/ y_test.shape[0]
print("Test Accuracy: %.2f%%"%(test_acc *100))
```

    Test Accuracy: 99.50%


## Test the kernel SVM on MNIST for classification

To further prove the effectiveness of the SVM model, we tested it on a slightly more complex problem: ditingush between digit "4" and digit "9" using SVM.

First of all, we need to load and prepare the data


```python
## load data
(mnist_x, mnist_y), _ = mnist.load_data()

## extract the digit "4" images (positive 1) and digit "9" images (negative 1)
x_pos= mnist_x[mnist_y == 4]
y_pos= np.ones( x_pos.shape[0] )
x_neg= mnist_x[mnist_y == 9]
y_neg= np.ones( x_neg.shape[0] ) *(-1)

## Put both positive/negative samples together to get the train/val/test dataset
x = np.concatenate( [ x_pos, x_neg ], axis =0 )
x = np.reshape(x, [x.shape[0],-1] )/255   ## normalization
y = np.concatenate( [ y_pos, y_neg], axis =0 )

## randomly shuffle
random_indx = np.random.permutation( np.arange( x.shape[0] ) )
x = x[random_indx]
y = y[random_indx]

## get x,y x_val, y_val, x_test, y_test
x_val = x[:500]
y_val = y[:500]
x_test = x[500:1000]
y_test = y[500:1000]
x = x[1000:2000]
y = y[1000:2000]
```

Train the SVM model


```python
## Estimate the value of sigma
sigma_mnist = np.mean( distance_matrix( x,y ) )*0.5

svm_mnist = SVM_Solver( kernel_type = {"name":"GAUSSIAN", "params":[sigma_mnist]} )
svm_mnist.train( x,y, x_val, y_val )
```

The Delta Objective Function is now less than epsilon= 1E-4, so the training is finished. Now we can test the classification results on test dataset.


```python
pred_y=svm_mnist.predict(x_test)
test_acc =  np.sum( pred_y == y_test  )/ y_test.shape[0]
print("Test Accuracy: %.2f%%"%(test_acc *100))
```

    Test Accuracy: 95.60%


Moreover, we can also have a look of the support_x to see what do the support vectors look like:


```python
support_x_pos = svm_mnist.support_x[ svm_mnist.support_y==1 ]
support_x_neg = svm_mnist.support_x[ svm_mnist.support_y==-1 ]

fig=plt.figure(figsize=(10, 2), dpi= 80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
plt.gray()
for i in range( 10 ):
    plt.subplot(2,10,i+1)
    plt.imshow( np.reshape(support_x_pos[i,:],[28,28] ))
    plt.title("digit 4")
    plt.axis('off')
    
for i in range( 10 ):
    plt.subplot(2,10,i+11)
    plt.imshow( np.reshape(support_x_neg[i,:],[28,28] ))
    plt.title("digit 9")
    plt.axis('off')

plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=1,  hspace=1)
plt.show()
```

From the results we can see the support vectors are somehow ambiguous to distinguish. E.g, the 9th digit 4 looks also like digit 9, and the second digit 9 also looks like digit 4. The SVM model is sensitive to such ambiguous samples and tend to use them as support vectors to determine the separating hyperplane.

**Conclusion**

In these long series, we mathematically show the principle of SVM and many possible solutions to the problem. We also show the implementation and performance on some small but interesting samples. Hope this could be somehow helpful.
