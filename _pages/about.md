I'm Nianlong Gu, a Machine Learning Scientist at [Universität Zürich](https://www.liri.uzh.ch/). I earned my PhD in Computer Science from [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/), where I developed advanced NLP models for scientific literature retrieval, extractive summarization, and LLM-based citation text generation. My current research focuses on AI-based vocal segmentation and speech recognition, crucial for bioacoustic studies and language evolution research. I also develop web platform to assist researchers in annotating audio files using AI.

### Research Interests

- Vocal Segmentation and Speech Recognition
  - AI-based tools for human and animal voice activity detection
  - Enhancing bioacoustic research and cross-species vocal comparisons
  - Utterance extraction and transcription pipelines for minor languages

- Information Retrieval and Document Summarization
  - Efficient retrieval systems for large-scale scientific databases
  - Summarization models for scientific articles
  - Large language models for scientific writing and discovery
  - Deep learning and reinforcement learning applications
